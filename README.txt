What did each group member contribute?

    We both contributed to the code in player.cpp and player.hpp. Specifically Ruy coded the scoring mechanisms using the corners and sides and the second version of minimax. Shirley implemented the first version of minimax and part of the second version of minimax.
 
Improvements:

    First we made a better scoring system in which we increased the values of the corners, sides and decreased the values of the moves adjacent to the corners. We then implemented minimax and changed the depth at which it went. We first used a simpler scoring mechanism, then adapted the code to use a more complex one. Lastly, we fiddled around with the exact depth of minimax and the change in values of the more complex scoring method.
